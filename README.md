# DogTeethAge

The most practical method for estimating dog age is by the examination of his teeth. Unfortunately, human's accuracy of this method decreases sharply after a dog reaches its adulthood. This is because the permanent (adult) teeth are usually all visible by approximately 6 months and after that, the age assessment depends only on the general state of the teeth and gingiva  (tooth wear, cementum, and pulp cavity). Variations in diets, behavior, genetics, as well as diseases and trauma, can all influence those factors and introduce an "uncertainty" that is increasing with ageing.

We hope that with the appropriate database, Deep Learning will be able to provide a more objective estimation of teeth age. 

This is **open research** which means that we are providing both the dataset and the code **before** publishing the paper. If you would like to contribute to this project you can do that through this GitHub page or you can contact us through the email.
